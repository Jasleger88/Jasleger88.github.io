Witnessing her strength and resilience, I resolved to tackle any challenge head-on, leading me to pursue a rigorous education in software development, including attending General Assembly classes at 4 AM while in another country.</span>

I thrive on collaboration, ensuring that everyone is aligned and working towards common goals. My technical pursuits are complemented by my dedication to maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I love to travel the world, spend quality time with my daughter, explore new cuisines, and stay active through regular workouts to ensure my mental well-being and relaxation.</span>
                </p> <br />
                <p>
                    <span>As a motivator and team player, I have also coached volleyball, further showcasing my ability to lead and inspire. My passion for helping others and fostering a cohesive team environment drives my commitment to developing innovative solutions and writing clean, efficient code. I excel under pressure and enjoy bringing humor and a positive attitude to the workplace.</span>
